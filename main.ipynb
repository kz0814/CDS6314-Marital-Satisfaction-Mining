    "\n",
    "This project aims to perform association rule mining on the \"Marital satisfaction, sex, age, marriage duration, religion, number of children, economic status, education, and collectivistic values: Data from 33 countries\" dataset (Sorokowski et al., 2017). The primary objective is to uncover interesting associations and patterns within this data, particularly focusing on factors related to marital satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow a data mining pipeline involving data exploration, preprocessing, application of association rule mining algorithms, and evaluation of the discovered rules. This notebook documents the Python implementation of these steps.\n",
